  <history>
	  After leaving the AAA games industry, Alex's first project of his own always had to be a sci-fi survival game. 
	  Inspired both by classics like Lego Rock Raiders and modern survival gems like Subnautica, Meridian: Frontier is a love letter 
	  to story-driven singleplayer exploration, built around compelling physics-based gathering and base-building features.
